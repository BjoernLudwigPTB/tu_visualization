# TU visualization

This repository holds the *VEX* code I wrote for the tutorials of the TU Berlin
summer 2019 lectures for *Mathematical visualization*.

## Documentation

Find the *Doxygen* documentation for the code
[here](https://bjoernludwigptb.github.io/tu_visualization/).

## Python in Houdini

To install custom packages in the existing python environment of *Houdini 17.5*
I followed [these](http://ytini.com/getstarted.html) instructions up to the
point where `pip` is installed and from then on installed the needed packages
from command line.

The instructions at the linked page include a step by step guide for previous
Houdini versions as well.
